Project Plan

We have made meetings every Thursday for the past 3 weeks.
In the first week 28/3, we discussed the assignment and get a brief picture about 
the whole assignment.
In the second week 4/4, we started the assignment and set up a git repository on 
github.com and assigned a few tasks to everyone.
In the third week 11/4, we assign more tasks to everybody and we plan to
complete project the next two weeks.

We split the tasks equally and so each person handles equal parts of message 
sending. And we plan to discuss which model to be used to implement the server
and peer loop. 
One person will be handling INVALID_PROTOCOL
• CONNECTION_REFUSED
The other will be handling HANDSHAKE_REQUEST, HANDSHAKE_RESPONSE
• FILE_CREATE_REQUEST, FILE_CREATE_RESPONSE
Another will be handling FILE_DELETE_REQUEST, FILE_DELETE_RESPONSE
• FILE_MODIFY_REQUEST, FILE_MODIFY_RESPONSE
The last will be handling DIRECTORY_CREATE_REQUEST, DIRECTORY_CREATE_RESPONSE
• DIRECTORY_DELETE_REQUEST, DIRECTORY_DELETE_RESPONSE
• FILE_BYTES_REQUEST, FILE_BYTES_RESPONSE

And the server we plan to do it togheter. 

We plan to write the report in the last week and this will give us enough time
to finish the project and submit.
